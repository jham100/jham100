## Hi, Iâ€™m @jham100. Nice to meet you. ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a full stack web developer, and am also in the process of learning to use the Unity game engine.

Some of my favorite technologies to use are:
- HTML, CSS, and JS
  - HTML5
  - CSS grid, flexbox, transitions (all that good stuff).
- Node.js
- React
- Python
  - Django
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
- MySQL
- Oracle SQL

...among others.
